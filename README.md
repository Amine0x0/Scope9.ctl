Scope9 is a minimalist personal hub for managing manually written extensions and scripts, think of it as a mini local software that can run any code on local network. It features a retro CRT interface , real-time terminal output, and arrow-key navigation for running backend tasks. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript , .NET Core for the backend, Lua scripts for the extensions and Python for CI/CD testing, docker and so much more!.
